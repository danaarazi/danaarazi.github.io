          <h2>What is the Sign For...</h2>
<p>Watch this video and follow the instructions. This is one of the most important lessons you will learn this semester. &nbsp;If you don't know a word in ASL and want to know it, this is how you ask.</p>
<p><iframe title="2-12 how do you sign" src="https://vod.ccctechconnect.org/veo/198614/d6cf54b63310d11205896c37a4cbdac2f8f05dcc" width="640" height="360" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>PRO TIP:</h3>
<p>Do not use English in any way. &nbsp;No writing, spelling, texting, mouthing, or any other form of English. &nbsp;You should be able to use the language to learn new words in the language.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>Now that you know this skill, you are forbidden from asking for ASL signs using English ever again. The ASL police will come to your door and look upon you with a disparaging expression.</p>
